- The research's main App is a pokemon like game where you catches animals.
- The Animal's information is shared after the capture, wherein it's presented in a dialogue-esque manner
- There's a separate mode called 3D mode where the animals are instead displayed in a completely virtual environment
- The environment is based on the Animal's habitat
